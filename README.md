# JSX App with React

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic React application using JSX. It includes an example of importing and rendering a React component (`App`) from a separate file into the main `index.js` file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. **Install NodeJS**

Before starting, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. Node.js is required to run React applications.

### 2. **Set Up the React App**

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to create the project.
3. Run the following command to create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app jsx-app
```

This will create a folder named `jsx-app` with all the necessary files and dependencies for a React project.

4. Navigate into the project folder:
   `cd jsx-app`
